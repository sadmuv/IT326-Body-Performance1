# IT326-Body-Performance1
# Body Performance Classification and Clustering

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing human body performance data using data mining techniques.
The goal is to study how physical and fitness-related attributes affect overall body performance and to discover patterns in the data.

The project applies classification to predict performance classes and clustering to group individuals with similar physical characteristics.

## Project Goal
- Classify individuals into performance levels (A, B, C, D) based on body performance attributes.
- Cluster individuals according to similarities in their physical fitness measurements.

## Motivation
Analyzing body performance is important in health, fitness assessment, and sports science.
This dataset was selected because it contains real-world physical performance measurements, clear class labels, and a sufficient number of records and attributes, making it suitable for data mining tasks.

- Name: Body Performance Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Format: CSV
- Number of Records: More than 13,000
- Number of Attributes: 12
- Class Label: class (A, B, C, D)
